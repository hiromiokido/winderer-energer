# Wind Energy Group
The Wind Energy Group, from Renewable Energy Research, was created to apply, research, and study tools for data science and data engineering using wind energy data. To generate simulated data, we will be running an OpenFAST container in Azure. OpenFAST is a reliable tool that generates high-fidelity data from wind turbines. Through this development, we want to generate multiple Docker containers that run simulations of a wind turbine model with different characteristics in a cloud provider.
